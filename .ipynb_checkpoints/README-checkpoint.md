# AttUNet for Drosophila Cardiac Analysis

Trained an Attention UNet to segment Drosophila hearts in cardiac recordings from from optical microscopy. I pretrain the AttUNet loosely following the methodology outlined in the paper *Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners* (He et al., 2022). 


## Future Work

I am currently working on replicating this work with Vision Transformers. I also need to do the following

- Integrate argparser for train.py
- Ablation study at some point 
- Create some cool animations...
